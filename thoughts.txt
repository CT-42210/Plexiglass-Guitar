necicary things to think about

lazer cut reference:
- it may be smart to lazercut one plexiglass as a reference for the measurements
    - it might be difficult to see how it all comes together with actual measurements
    - can use dry erase marker >:)

scale length: (check [links.md] )
- distance from nut to 12th fret is the same distance from 12th fret to saddle
    - we have a choice: 
        - place the bridge first
        - place the kneck first 
            - problably the smarter idea

hiding wires:
- we may want to make wiring tunnels smaller, to make it less obvious
