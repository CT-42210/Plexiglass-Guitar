Plexiglass Guitar Description

steps to finnish:
- finnish designing rough vectors
- polish vectors, with exact layers and to scale
- lasercut the Plexiglas
- paint the plexiglass layers
- fuse the guitar body together (unsure how to do this)
- install all the components the way a normal guitar would work
- string
- test

if it works, hurray!
